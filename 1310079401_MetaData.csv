1,"Source: Statistics Canada, Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) - Nutrition, 2004 and 2015."
2,"The target population of the survey covers the population 1 year of age and over living in the ten provinces. Excluded from the survey's coverage are: persons living on reserves and other Aboriginal settlements, full-time members of the Canadian Forces and the institutionalized population."
3,"The World Health Organisation (WHO) standard for BMI is also known as the International Standard."
4,"Measured body mass index (BMI) is calculated by dividing the respondent's measured body weight (in kilograms) by their measured height (in metres) squared."
5,"The index is: less than 18.50 (underweight); 18.50 to 24.99 (normal weight), 25.00 to 29.99 (overweight); 30.00 to 34.99 (obese, class I); 35.00 to 39.99 (obese, class II); 40.00 or greater (obese, class III)."
6,"Body mass index (BMI) is a method of classifying body weight according to health risk. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Health Canada guidelines, health risk levels are associated with each of the following BMI categories: normal weight = least health risk; underweight and overweight = increased health risk; obese, class I = high health risk; obese, class II = very high health risk; obese, class III = extremely high health risk."
7,"Bootstrapping techniques were used to produce the coefficient of variation (CV) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)."
8,"Data with a coefficient of variation (CV) from 16.6% to 33.3% are identified by an (E) and should be interpreted with caution."
9,"Data with a coefficient of variation (CV) greater than 33.3% were suppressed (F) due to extreme sampling variability."
10,"The Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) - Nutrition, the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) and the CCHS - Annual, all collect height and weight data and derive obesity rates based on Body Mass Index (BMI). Users should take note of the data collection method, the target population and the classification system used by each survey in order to select the appropriate data set."
11,"Percentages are rounded to the nearest tenth. Numbers are rounded to the nearest hundred."
12,"The CANSIM table 105-2023 is an update of CANSIM table 105-2001."
13,"Excluding pregnant females."
14,"All rates in this table are calculated excluding non-response categories ("refusal", "don't know", and "not stated") in the denominator."
